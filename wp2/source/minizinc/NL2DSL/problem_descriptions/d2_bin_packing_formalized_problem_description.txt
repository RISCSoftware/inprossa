    This problem involves a collection of items, where each have a value and a weight. We have 6 different items given in the parameters.
    We have a infinite number of boxes with width BOX_WIDTH and height BOX_HEIGHT. All items need to be packed into minimal number of such boxes.
    The result and expected output is:
        - the assigment of each item into a box and 
        - the position (x and y) of each item within its assigned box.
    """,
    """Sub problem definition - items that go in the bin:
    Taking the given items that are put into a box must fit exactly inside a box. 
    They must not stick out of the box and must not overlap.
    One item can be exactly in one box.
    The result and expected output is the assigment of each item into a box and the position of each item within its assigned box.
