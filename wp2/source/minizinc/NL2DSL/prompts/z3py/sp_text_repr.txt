Create a very short, concise textual description of:
    1. possible non-python record-like datatypes types with object fields, that may be created specifically for this problem. Just objects, no array of objects.
    2. constants (input), each with a suggested variable name and values,
    3. decision variables (output), each with a suggested name and description.
    4. an objective, that is calculated.
    5. and constraints for the problem below.
The result must not be code or json, just text or pseudo-code.
The result must be written in a way that a software engineer may create a program from it.
Also mention the specific values of variables, constants etc. Mention values of each object field of each constant object or constant array of objects.
Output the descriptions in the following format:
--- Objects ---
<placeholder for datatypes for LLM>
--- Constants ---
<placeholder for constants for LLM>
--- Decision variables ---
<placeholder for decision variables for LLM>
--- Objective function ---
<placeholder for obj. function for LLM>
--- Constraints ---
<placeholder for constraints for LLM>
