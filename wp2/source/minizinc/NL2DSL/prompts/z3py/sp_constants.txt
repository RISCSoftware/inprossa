Add constants from the given parameters and pack them into a Json:
1. Names for constants are in capital letters only.
2. Utilize the given datatypes! Apply them correctly.
3. Use any primitive or complex datatypes (e.g. lists), but no dict.
4. If there are one or more constants in the \"sub problem definitions\" that are not defined yet, then define them.
5. The collection of the resulting constants must be complete and represent all described constants.
6. Above each constant put a python comment with a description of that constant.
7. There must be one or more constants.
8. The result must not contain any constraints.
9. The result must be minimal but most of all, semantically correct in respect to the description.
10. The result must not be "NTD".
11. Do not define decision variables.
12. The result must not contain any of the given datatypes.
14. Define the length of lists and arrays as separate constants.
15. The result must be a Json or text, but code only.
16. Do not come up with any examples, only use what is asked and given.
17. Do not return any reasoning text or explanation.

Return you answer in the following format:
[{
     "description":<description>,
     "variable_name":<variable_name>,
     "initialization":<initialization>
}]
The structure must fulfill following requirements:
1. <variable_name> is the python variable described in description. The variable name that represents a variable that will later be used. Constants naming convention: capital letters only.
2. <initialization> is the python variable declaration and initialization code block, fully with assignments, of the variable in variable field.
3. <description> is a placeholder for a compact, concise description of the variable.
4. No additional properties allowed.
