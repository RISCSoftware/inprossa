Define required data types (as Datatype Class Reference provided by z3), if there are any needed as z3 python code.
Be very careful with this step, only define records if needed for the described problem. If that is the case return empty output.
If that is the case return empty output. But if possible, do create datatypes.
If tuples will be required in the future, create datatypes instead.
If a parameter has a complex object-like structure create a fitting datatype for it.
If a output or result has a complex object-like structure create a fitting datatype for it.
You also may use StringSort(), IntSort(), StringVal, IntVal. Do not use ArraySort.
Do not define constants.
Do not define instances.
Do not define any decision variables or variables.
Do not define constraints.
Do not return json or text, but code only.
Do not return any reasoning text or explanation.
You are strongly encouraged to use datatypes.
Refrain from including \"from z3 import *\" and "\s = Optimize()\".
