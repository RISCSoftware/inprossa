Add the objective function as z3 python code.
    1. The result must not be \"NTD\".
    2. Must not contain given constants declarations.
    3. Must not contain given decision variable declarations.
    4. Do NOT define constraints.
    5. Take \"s = Optimize()\" as given.
    6. The objective is a specific variable and must be defined in z3py, with optimization solver's function s.minimize or s.maximize that take the value that should be minimized or maximized as parameter.
    7. Do not return json.
    8. The objective must be calculated, just defining it is not enough.
    9. Never use Assign, Dict, Constant, Call.
