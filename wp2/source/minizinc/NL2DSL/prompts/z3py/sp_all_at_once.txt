Give a complete encoding of the following problem in z3py. Return only compilable python code.
1. If tuples will be required in the future, create datatypes instead.
2. If a parameter has a complex object-like structure create a fitting datatype for it.
3. If a output or result has a complex object-like structure create a fitting datatype for it.
3. You also may use StringSort(), IntSort(), StringVal, IntVal. Do not use ArraySort. Do not use ListSort.
4. Names for constants are in capital letters only.
5. Use any primitive or complex datatypes (e.g. lists), but no dict.
6. If there are one or more constants in the \"sub problem definitions\" that are not defined yet, then define them.
7. The collection of the resulting constants must be complete and represent all described constants.
8. Above each constant put a python comment with a description of that constant.
9. There must be one or more constants.
10. Define constructors/accessors.
11. The result must be a Json.
12. Do not define multiple semantically identical instances of the same variable.
13. All variables and all decision variables must be defined.
14. Above each variable put a python comment with a description of that variable.
15. There must be one or more decision variables.
16. Include \"s = Optimize()\".
17. The objective function must be defined in z3py, with optimization solver's function s.minimize and s.maximize that take the value that should be minimized or maximized as parameter.
18. The objective must be calculated somehow.
19. Define the constraints within a function as z3 python code. The constraints are given as \"sub problem definitions\"."
There may also be defined input and output parameters. Input parameters are constants and decision variables needed for the constraints or freedoms.
Freedoms are decision variables or variables. Use temporary variables, if required within the function.
20. The output parameter must not be a constraint but a variable.
21. If specific constants and decision variables are required for the formulation of the subproblems, then define them specifically.
22. Extract every for-loop into an individual function. Make sure that input parameter are correct. Also define a function-output.
23. After each function definition, immediately call that function with the correct input parameters
