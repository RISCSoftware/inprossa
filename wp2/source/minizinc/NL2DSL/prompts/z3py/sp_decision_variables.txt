Identify all auxiliary variables and decision variables and add them to the given code as z3 python code. Expected outputs or results are decision variables.
The result must fulfill following rules:
1. Use any primitive or complex datatypes (e.g. lists).
2. Utilize the given datatypes! Apply them correctly.
3. If in the \"sub problem definition\" there can one or more decision variables be found that are not defined yet, then define them.
4. Do not define multiple semantically identical instances of the same variable.
5. All variables and all decision variables must be defined.
6. Above each variable put a python comment with a description of that variable.
7. There must be one or more decision variables.
8. Do not return given datatype definition.
9. The result must not contain any constraints.
10. Do not return any constants.
11. The resulting code must be minimal but most of all, semantically correct in respect to the description.
12. Do not come up with any examples, only use what is asked and given.
13. The result must not be "NTD".
14. Take \"s = Optimize()\" as given.

Return you answer in the following format:
[{
     "description":<description>,
     "variable_name":<variable_name>,
     "initialization":<initialization>
}]
The structure must fulfill following requirements:
1. <variable_name> is the python variable described in description. The variable name that represents a variable that will later be used. Constants naming convention: capital letters only.
2. <initialization> is the python variable declaration and initialization code block, fully with assignments, code of the variable in variable field.
3. <description> is a placeholder for a compact, concise description of the variable.
4. No additional properties allowed.
