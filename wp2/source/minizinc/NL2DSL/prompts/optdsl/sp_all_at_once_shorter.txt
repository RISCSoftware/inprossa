Give a complete encoding of the following problem in OptDSL. Return only compilable python code.
1. If tuples will be required in the future, create objects instead.
2. If a parameter has a complex object-like structure create a fitting datatype for it.
3. If a output or result has a complex object-like structure create a fitting datatype for it.
4. Names for constants (input variables) are written in upper capital letters only.
5. Names for decision variables (output variables) and auxilary variables are written in lower letters only.
6. Define the length of arrays as separate integer constants.
7. Make sure to always close all open brackets.
8. The collection of the resulting constants must be complete and represent all described constants.
9. There must be one or more constants.
10. All variables and all decision variables must be defined. There must be one or more decision variables.
11. Do not define multiple semantically identical instances of the same variable.
12. All constants, variables and all decision variables must have an explicit type (int, float, object type, DSInt(), DSBool, etc.).18.
13. Use the OptDSL from the system prompt and the in-context-learning example.
14. The objective variable as OptDSL code. The objective variable is a variable that is named \"objective\" which is always ready-to-use and available in OptDSL. If the objective is defined as a decision variable assign it to objective variable.
15. The objective must be in code and it must be calculated.
16. If there are one or more constants in the \"sub problem definitions\" that are not defined yet, then define them in the current section.
