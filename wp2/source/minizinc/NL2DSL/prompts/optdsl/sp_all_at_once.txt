Give a complete encoding of the following problem in OptDSL. Return only compilable python code.
1. If tuples will be required in the future, create objects instead.
2. If a parameter has a complex object-like structure create a fitting datatype for it.
3. If a output or result has a complex object-like structure create a fitting datatype for it.
4. Names for constants (input variables) are written in upper capital letters only.
5. Names for decision variables (output variables) and auxilary variables are written in lower letters only.
6. Use any primitive or complex objects (e.g. lists), but no dict.
7. Define the length of arrays as separate integer constants.
8. Make sure to always close all open brackets.
9. If there are one or more constants in the \"sub problem definitions\" that are not defined yet, then define them in the current section.
10. The collection of the resulting constants must be complete and represent all described constants.
11. Above each constant put a python comment with a description of that constant.
12. There must be one or more constants.
13. The result must not be a Json.
14. Do not define multiple semantically identical instances of the same variable.
15. All variables and all decision variables must be defined.
16. All constants, variables and all decision variables must have an explicit type (int, float, object type, DSInt(), DSBool, etc.).
17. Above each variable put a python comment with a description of that variable.
18. There must be one or more decision variables.
19. Use the OptDSL from the system prompt and the in-context-learning example.
20. The objective variable as OptDSL code. The objective variable is a variable that is named \"objective\" which is always ready-to-use and available in OptDSL. If the objective is defined as a decision variable assign it to objective variable.
21. The objective must be in code and it must be calculated.
22. You are obliged to use the given object types, list types, constants and decision variables
23. Define the constraints within a function as OptDSL python code. The constraints are given as \"sub problem definitions\"."
There may also be defined input and output parameters. Input parameters are constants and decision variables needed for the constraints or freedoms.
Freedoms are decision variables or variables. Use temporary variables, if required within the function. Define equality and inequality constraints as asserts only.
24. The output parameter must not be a constraint but a variable.
25. If specific constants and decision variables are required for the formulation of the subproblems, then define them specifically.
26. Extract every for-loop into an individual function. Make sure that input parameter are correct. Also define a function-output.
27. After each function definition, immediately call that function with the correct input parameters
28. Do not use the function len(), instead define the required array length manually with hard coded correct number.
29. You are prohibited from using DSList directly as function parameter type. Use a declared type instead. See In-context learning example for function heads.
