Extend the given OptDSL python code snippet, with constraints exactly according to the given subproblem as OptDSL python code. Define nothing else. The constraints are given as \"sub problem definitions\"."
    The constraints must exactly represent the subproblem description, nothing else.
    1. Use given datatypes, constants and decision variables in the given python snippet, nothing else.
    2. Defined objects must be used as in the in-context-learning example.
    3. Do not repeat already present definitions. Do not add redundancies.
    4. Add required auxiliary variables, that are not defined yet.
    5. Auxiliary variables at root and within functions, may be of type int, float, str, list or dict. Auxiliary variables and temporary variables of an object type must be declared with that object type, also within functions.
    6. Avoid introducing auxiliary variables which are used only once.
    7. Add the function for calculation of the objective in OptDSL, if not defined yet. It is already defined, just add the calculation.
    8. After each function definition, immediately call that function with the correct input parameters.
    9. Each defined function must be called exactly once. The respective function must have a name that reflects the subproblem it encodes.
    10. Do not use any import or functions or variables from other packages.
    11. Make sure to close brackets appropriately.
    12. Do not come up with any examples and do not use placeholders.
    13. Do not return json. Do not return "NTD".
    14. The result must be compilable python OptDSL code.
    15. Use the EBNF grammar of OptDSL in the system prompt.
    16. Make sure the parameter list types in the function definition adhere to the EBNF grammar in the system prompt (e.g.  def some_func (x_list: DSList(length=20, elem_type: DSInt()), constant: float, dec_var: DSInt()): ).
    17. Do not use the function len(), instead define the required array length manually with a hard coded correct number.
    18. Add streamliners if possible. Constrain variables as much as possible in a sensible way.

Return you answer in the following format:
´´´python
# --- Auxiliary Variables ---
# Leave empty, if not required.

# --- Constraints ---
<solution>
´´´ replace <solution> with the code. <solution> must not be empty.
