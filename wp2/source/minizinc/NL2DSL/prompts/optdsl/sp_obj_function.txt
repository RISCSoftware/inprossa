Add the objective variable as OptDSL code. The objective variable is a variable that is named \"objective\".
    1. Do not return \"NTD\".
    2. Must not contain given constants declarations.
    3. Must not contain given decision variable declarations.
    4. Do NOT define constraints.
    5. Do not return json.
    6. Do not write any explanations, OptDSL code only. Python comments are allowed.
    7. Do not declare "objective". Do not define a type for it. It is an environment variable, that can be used out-of-the-box.
    8. If the objective is defined as a decision variable, set it equal to objective variable with assert.
    9. Add a function called "calculate_objective" where you calculate the objective variable or variable that represents the objective. This function must contain a calculation. Add streamliners for the objective, lower and upper bounds.
    10. When assigning a decision variable or a temporary variable which stores the return value of the function, to \"objective\", you must write it as follows:
    assert objective == <value>, where you replace <value> with decision variable or the temporary variable that represents the objective.
    11. You may use the assert call within the calculation function or outside, where you store the return value of the function into a temporary variable with correct type.


Return you answer in the following format:
´´´python
# --- Objective ---
<solution>
´´´ replace <solution> with the code. <solution> must not be empty.
