Define required object types as compilable OptDSL code, if there are any needed as pythonic OptDSL code.
Following requirements must be fulfilled:
    Be very careful with this step, only define records if needed for the described problem. If that is the case return empty output.
    1. If that is the case return empty output. But if possible, do create object types.
    2. If tuples will be required in the future, create object types instead.
    3. If a parameter has a complex object-like structure create a fitting object types for it.
    4. If a output or result has a complex object-like structure create a fitting object types for it.
    5. The members of an object must be of a DS-type (e.g. DSInt(), DSFloat(), DSBool()). Set lower (lb) and upper bound (ub) for DSInt. See EBNF grammar of OptDSL in the system prompt.
    6. Do not define constants.
    7. Do not define instances.
    8. Do not define any decision variables or variables.
    9. Do not define constraints.
    10. Do not define functions.
    11. Use float instead of str.
    12. Do not return json.
    13. You are strongly encouraged to use types.
    14. Do not use functions or variables from any other packages and do not import any.
    15. Use the description of OptDSL in the system prompt.
