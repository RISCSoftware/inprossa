[Task]
Write new encoding of an optimization problem taking the two given encodings.
Assume objects, constants and decision variables are defined somewhere else. Do not initialize objects, constants or decision variables.
Your implementation should be across over of the two implementations above,taking most ideas from the
better code ({}%) and only some ideas from the worse code ({}%).
Ensure that the new code maintains a comparable overall complexity and length to the
two implementations above.
Output code only and enclose your code with python codeblock: ```python... ```.
