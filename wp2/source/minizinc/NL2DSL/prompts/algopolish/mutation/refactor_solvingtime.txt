[Task]
The goal is to improve the solving-time of the encoded pythonic OptDsl model implemented above.
Do not initialize objects, constants or decision variables.
Modify the code so that the optimization-problem-solving-time is reduced, while preserving the encoded logic and constraints.
Output code only and enclose your code with python codeblock: ```python... ```.
