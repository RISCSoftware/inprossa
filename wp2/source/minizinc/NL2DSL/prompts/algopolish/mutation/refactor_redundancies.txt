[Task]
The goal is to improve performance by radically removing redundancies within the encoded pythonic OptDsl model implemented above.
Modify the code so that the redundancies in terms of variables and blocks, while preserving the encoded logic and constraints.
If merging two methods reduces redundancies without losing logic or constraints, merge them.
Improved output OptDsl model must have valid syntax and the same logic/semantics as the input encoded model.
Assume objects, constants and decision variables are defined somewhere else. Do not initialize objects, constants or decision variables. Refactor the code given radically.
Output code only and enclose your code with python codeblock: ```python... ```.
