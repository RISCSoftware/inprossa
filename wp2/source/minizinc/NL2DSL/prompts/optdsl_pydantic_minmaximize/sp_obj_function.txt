Add the objective. Minimizing and maximizing the objective is achieved by calling the built-in methods \"minimize\" or "\maximize"\ with the respective decision variable as agrument. Your priority is to write a function "calculate_objective".
    1. Do not return \"NTD\".
    2. Must not contain given constants declarations.
    3. Must not contain given decision variable declarations.
    4. Do NOT define constraints.
    5. Do not return json.
    6. Do not write any explanations, OptDSL code only. Python comments are allowed.
    7. If the objective is defined as a decision variable, use it for the following calculation function "calculate_objective".
    8. Add a function called "calculate_objective" where you calculate the objective variable or variable that represents the objective. This function must contain a calculation, do not return an unmodified variable. Then assign the return value of this function to a auxiliary variable objective "objective = calculate_objective(<parameters>)".
    9. Additionally, add streamliners for the objective, lower and upper bounds.
    10. Finally, pass the variable "objective" to the fitting optimization function "minimize" or "maximize":
    "minimize(objective)" or "maximize(objective)", where you replace <value> with decision variable that represents the objective.
    11. Never call both, "minimize" or "maximize". Call one exactly once within the encoding.
    13. Use at least one of the given decision variable for the calculation of the objective variable.
    14. Also add the following line "objective = <value>", where you replace <value> with decision variable that represents the objective.
    15. As the very last line, assign the variable "objective" to a given decision variable, which represents the objective.


Return you answer in the following format:
´´´python
# --- Objective ---
def calculate_objective (...):
<solution>
objective = calculate_objective(...)
<decision_variable> = objective
minimize(objective)
´´´ replace <solution> with the code. <solution> must not be empty. And replace decision_variable with a given decision variable, which represents the objective
