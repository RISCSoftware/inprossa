Add the objective variable as OptDSL code. The objective variable is a variable that is named \"objective\".
    1. Do not return \"NTD\".
    2. Must not contain given constants declarations.
    3. Must not contain given decision variable declarations.
    4. Do NOT define constraints.
    5. Do not return json.
    6. Do not write any explanations, OptDSL code only. Python comments are allowed.
    7. Do not declare "objective". Do not define a type for it. It is an environment variable, that can be used out-of-the-box.
    8. If the objective is defined as a decision variable, set it equal to objective variable with assert.
    9. Add a function called "calculate_objective" where you calculate the objective variable or variable that represents the objective. This function must contain a calculation and be minimal, just returning a variable is not enough. Then assign the return value of this function to the given decision variable, which represents the objective, or to a temporary variable called "calculated_objective_value".
    10. Add streamliners for the objective, lower and upper bounds.
    11. When assigning a decision variable or a temporary variable which stores the return value of the function, to \"objective\", you must write it as follows:
    "objective = <value>", where you replace <value> with decision variable or the temporary variable that represents the objective.
    12. Use one or more of the given decision variables for the calculation of the objective variable.


Return you answer in the following format:
´´´python
# --- Objective ---
<solution>
´´´ replace <solution> with the code. <solution> must not be empty.
